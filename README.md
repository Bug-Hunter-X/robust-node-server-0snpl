# Node.js Server: Inconsistent Request Handling

This repository demonstrates a common yet often overlooked issue in Node.js server development: inconsistent handling of request data. The provided code is a basic HTTP server. However, it lacks robust error handling and input validation, making it vulnerable to various issues.

## Bug Description

The server may fail to handle large requests or requests with unusual characteristics (e.g., malformed JSON, unexpected headers) properly. This vulnerability can lead to denial-of-service attacks or unpredictable behavior.

## Solution

The solution addresses these vulnerabilities by implementing comprehensive error handling, input validation, and resource management. It includes checks for large requests and limits to protect against attacks. Proper JSON parsing and validation prevents unexpected behavior caused by malformed data.  The solution prioritizes responding gracefully with appropriate error messages to clients in case of failures.
